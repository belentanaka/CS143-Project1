We have implemented the pages I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, B1, B2, and S1.

Each page is separate; we did not combine any pages. B1 and B2 are only meant
to be accessed through searches via S1.

In addition, we also implemented a header, sidebar, and home page.

To improve collaboration in the future, we feel it would be better if we were
more knowledgeable on SQL and PHP syntax, data structures, etc.
